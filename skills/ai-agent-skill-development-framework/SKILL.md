3. **Integration**: Skills should work seamlessly with other components
4. **Documentation**: Clear documentation for maintenance and understanding

## Implementation Guidelines
- Define clear inputs and outputs for each skill
- Include error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Implement logging for debugging and improvement
- Design with scalability in mind
- Regular review and refinement cycles

## Best Practices
- Start with minimal viable skill implementation
- Test thoroughly in isolated environments
- Gradually integrate with broader system
- Monitor performance and adapt as needed
- Document lessons learned and improvements
